- "CANNED COMMENTS"
-
 - "The number of blocks involved by DCIS is correlated with the extent of DCIS up to 4 cm.8 Multiplying the number of blocks involved by DCIS by the approximate width of a tissue section gives an estimate of the
extent. In 2 studies, multiplying by 0.3 cm underestimated the extent of DCIS, and multiplying by 0.5 cm may overestimate the extent.8,9 Therefore, multiplying by 0.4 cm is recommended unless there is additional information that a different number would yield a more accurate result."
 - "COMMENT:  The size (extent) of DCIS is an estimation of the volume of breast tissue occupied by DCIS, and  the number of blocks ($)  involved by DCIS is correlated with the extent of DCIS. Multiplying the number of blocks involved by DCIS by an approximate width of tissue block of 0.4 cm is currently recommended by the 2010 CAP guidelines to estimate the size of the DCIS."
 - "COMMENT: The size (extent) of DCIS is an estimation of the volume of breast tissue occupied by DCIS, based on the number of blocks ($) involved by DCIS and on an approximate width of tissue block of 0.4 cm." 
 - "Note:  If there are multiple invasive carcinomas, size, grade, histologic type, and the results of studies for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu should pertain to the largest invasive carcinoma.  If smaller invasive carcinomas differ in any of these features, this information may be included in the 'Comments' section."
