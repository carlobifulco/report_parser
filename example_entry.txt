A)  LYMPH NODE, RIGHT, SENTINEL, EXCISION:

1.  Two lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma (0/2) by H&E and keratin stains.

COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains for keratin are negative.

B)  BREAST, RIGHT, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY:

1.  Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham combined histologic grade 2, measuring 1.9 cm in greatest dimension and extending to 0.6 cm from the closest surgical resection margin (see Pathology staging summary).

Pathology Staging Summary
*Specimen type: Simple mastectomy (including nipple and skin)
*Laterality: right
*Tumor type(s) present: Invasive and in situ carcinoma
*Tumor Site: Upper Outer Quadrant
*Invasive Carcinoma Histologic Type: Invasive ductal
*Size of Invasive Component: 1.9 cm
*Histologic Grade (Nottingham Combined Histologic Score): G2 (Tubular differentiation: 3/3; Nuclear grade: 2/3; Mitotic count: 2/3; Total score: 7/9)
*Tumor Focality: Single focus of invasive carcinoma
*Histologic Type of DCIS: cribriform
*Grade of DCIS: intermediate grade
*Estimated Size (extent) of DCIS: minimal microscopic component
*Necrosis in DCIS: Present, focal (small foci or single cell necrosis)
*Lymphovascular Invasion: Negative
*Perineural Invasion: Negative
*Nipple: DCIS does not involve the nipple epidermis
*Skin: Invasive carcinoma does not invade into the dermis or epidermis
*Skeletal Muscle: No skeletal muscle present
*Surgical Margins for the Invasive Carcinoma: negative
*Distance from the closest margin for the Invasive Carcinoma: posterior 0.6 cm macroscopic assessment, see gross description
*Lymph node sampling: Sentinel lymph node(s) only
*Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 2
*Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined: 0/2
*The remaining breast shows: fibroadenomatoid changes, sclerosing adenosis
*Pathologic Stage (AJCC 7th Edition): pT1c (sn)pN0

*Special studies (estrogen and progesterone receptors, mib-1 and HER-2/neu by FISH) have not been ordered on this specimen, as they had already been performed on the previous biopsy (SP-11-11914) and were reported as follows:
*ER/PR hormone receptors: ER positive; PR positive
*Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1): high
*HER-2/neu by FISH: negative

Gross Description

A)  RIGHT SENTINEL NODE:  Received fresh labeled Wurdeman, Susan Kay, is a 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm piece of fatty tissue containing two lymph nodes which measure 1.2 cm and 2.0 cm in greatest dimension.  The lymph nodes are submitted in toto for frozen section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT PROVIDENCE PORTLAND MEDICAL CENTER:  TWO LYMPH NODE FRAGMENTS, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.  (JDH).

B)  RIGHT BREAST:  Received fresh labeled Wurdeman, Susan Kay, is the product of a right simple mastectomy which is oriented by the surgeon as follows:  one clip 12:00, two clips medial.  The specimen weights 356 grams and measures 17 x 15 x 3.5 cm.  There is an overlying 7.5 x 4 cm ellipse of tan skin with a central raised nipple.  The margins are marked as follows:  superoanterior - orange, inferoanterior - green, posterior - black.  Cut surfaces have abundant fibrous tan-white breast tissue with innumerable cysts and nodules.  In the upper inner quadrant is a 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm indurated stellate gray-white tumor located 0.6 cm from the posterior margin.  A single lymph node is present in the upper outer quadrant 1 cm in greatest dimension.

SECTIONS:
B1)  nipple;
B2)  posterior margin;
B3)  superoanterior margin;
B4)  lateral aspect of tumor;
B5)  midportion of tumor;
B6)  medial aspect of tumor;
B7)  representative sections from lower inner quadrant greater than 2 cm from tumor;
B8)  representative sections from upper inner quadrant within 2 cm of tumor;
B9)  representative sections from lower outer quadrant greater than 2 cm from tumor;
B10)  representative sections from upper outer quadrant greater than 2 cm from tumor;
B11)  one lymph node bisected and entirely submitted.
